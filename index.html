      <p>I am an aspiring developer with a strong foundation in C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
        complemented by a 2-year degree in computer networking.. Over 2 years in IT support roles. Most
         recent position as a support specialist where I played a crucial role as the bridge between the
          customer-facing service department and the software team at an industrial x-ray company.
           Responsibilities included documenting and managing software bug reports from customers,
            and ensuring seamless communication and resolution for the customer. Experience with
             working for a managed service provider. Eager to learn new development languages and
              tools. Ready to transition into a career in software development to apply my
               skills in creating impactful solutions.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
       <strong> point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
